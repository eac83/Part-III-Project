# Part-III-Project

This repo contains the code I used in my Master's project, "Powerful AGN outflows at cosmic noon can solve the S_8 tension?". For this project I mostly used Python in Jupyter Notebooks to analyse the data from simulations, with a few Python scripts for more demanding tasks. Note that the raw data has not been including, so there is no guarentee that all notebooks will run.
